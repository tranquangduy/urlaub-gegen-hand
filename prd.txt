# Risks and Mitigations  

## Database Scalability Issues
- **Risk**: Performance degradation with growing user base
- **Mitigation**: Implement proper indexing, connection pooling, and consider read replicas

## Authentication Security Breaches
- **Risk**: Unauthorized access and data theft
- **Mitigation**: Regular security audits, keeping dependencies updated, implementing MFA

## Performance Degradation
- **Risk**: Slow page loads and poor user experience as app grows
- **Mitigation**: CDN integration, edge caching, code splitting, image optimization

## API Abuse and Scraping
- **Risk**: Automated data harvesting and system abuse
- **Mitigation**: Rate limiting, CAPTCHA for sensitive operations, API keys

## Data Protection Compliance
- **Risk**: GDPR and other regulatory violations
- **Mitigation**: Privacy-by-design approach, data minimization, consent management
